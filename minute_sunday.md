# Metabrain Workshop

##Sunday 2016-01-10

* establish own identity, separate from social collective
* main target group: online platforms, search sites for refugee projects
* long term goal: we want a (data) exchange with databases in other European
  countries, do not favor one central European database

### Internal Organization
* project management tool: trello or waffle.io?
* tool for communication, rethink slack channel system
* waffle requires a github account, complexity of github is a burden for many
* concepts of tasks (on trello) need to be translated into concrete development
  needs anyway (github issues), lack of github integration with free version not
  a big deal
* we need to write an introduction to any tool we choose
* we can delay the decision, first clarify what our needs are and who will be
  part of the project
* we need to write down an organization chart
* this is done and on Trello board

### Discussion USEEDS' Workshop Jan 28-29
* who will be present, who else should be invited, what can be done during those
  days?
    * 4 frontend developer
    * 5-6 visual designer
    * 15 concepter
    * 5 researcher
    * 2-3 with background in business
    * 1-3 from metabrain
    * begin around 10 and presentation at 17 hours each day
    * other projects present: Kreativhaus, Netzwerk "Wir Nachbarn"
* potential workshop session:
    * re-evaluate target groups and develop personas
    * re-evaluate whether goals and ideas actually match needs
    * prefer qualitative to quantitative research feedback
    * results of survey can be a form of legitimization of our work
        * check overlap with previous surveys
    * discuss our organizational structure and plans with a business savvy person
    * general USEEDS approach, first explore user groups then design
    * metabrain has working hypotheses
 * we need to find more people in time for the HKW event
 * let content for landing page be implemented by frontend developer
* after discussion the following options emerge:
    1. Evaluation of demand
    2. Design
    3. UI
* we should discuss categories after we know our goals
* first day should focus on research (user survey), then develop ideas for
  database interactions
* what kind of information do the other platforms need from us?
    * could be search engines
    * platforms as mechanism for distribution
* Peter Sikking (m+mi works) has influential views on machine-machine
  and human-machine interactions
* Moritz would like to be involved in backend development (adaptation of
  socialprohub code)

### To Do
* need to talk to Finn, see where he stands
* merge the frontend of socialprohub and refugeeboard?
* button: powered by metabrain

### Categories
* how do projects work together? that's a topic for later
* events and news
    * also later, very dynamic data
    * even harder to keep up to date
    * might be implemented with a crawler
* community aspect and social encounters
* research what strategies different platforms implement and how they thus model
  the data
* want additional role for refugees at refugeeboard.de
* project status and phases:
    * idea
    * implementation
    * active
    * inactive
    * joined, formed other project x
 * what are categories
   * volunteer work: what?
   * what am I looking for?
   * what do I offer?
* step 1, list all, step 2, display current needs (ever changing data)
* we do not one-on-one offers

* Provide complete list of categories/tags

### Database Schema
* provide a short description of each field
* fundraising platforms, could be a service for other platforms
* address field with c/o option
* discussion on data privacy (could be checked at USEEDS survey)
    * need clear decision from projects
    * send anonymous mail to projects when contact is established
* zip code should automatically be resolved to geo-location
* open text fields (project description) will need translation (future service)
* abstract categories for location?
* user votes, trust as a variable
* user feedback in form of comments?
* how detailed should our information be, fall back on experience by other
  projects
* other measures for review:
    * project reach (area, number of users)
    * Facebook likes
    * Twitter follower
    * project size
    * funding status -> should become a category (interested, not interested,
      funded)
    * project age
* type of organization (NGO, grass-roots, etc.)
* liability for data, should we start with a reduced set of variables?
* how does the project work (only digital, hands-on?)
* existing cooperations
* developers as separate target group
* differentiate between small and large projects
* how to get in touch and physically meet project
