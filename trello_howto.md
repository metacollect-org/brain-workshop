# How to use the Trello board

For our workflow, we need a project management tool for all the different tasks
that need to be done and solved. We decided on using Trello to organize our to
do list.  Everyone contributing to Metabrain should be part of our Trello boards.

## How to use Trello

There are three different Trello Boards so far:
* General: This is where we collect all project management tasks. Here, we also define the
organizational structure
* Backend: All tasks regarding the backend/data structure
* Landing page: All tasks on creating a landing page In the future, there might be
more Trello boards (e.g., public relations). We will discuss the purpose of
those boards within those boards and also post them within the slack channel.

## There are different lists within each Trello board:

1. To Do: Here, we define all working packages by a card each. We need the following information for each new working package:
    * priority, defined by color labels: low (yellow), medium (orange), high (red)
    * due date
    * responsible persons
    * clear discription
2. In Progress: Once you start to work on a working package, please move the card in here. If there are needs for comments (e.g., important realization, problems, status), please comment in the card.
3. Done: Once a task is solved/done, please move it in here.
4. In Review: The project management team will take a look at the solution.
5. Accepted: Once the task is solved, the project management team will move this card in here.
