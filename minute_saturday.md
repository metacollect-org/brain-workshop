# Metabrain Workshop

## Saturday 2016-01-09

### Participants:
* WeConnect: Robert
* InfoCompass: Jan, Stefan
* Refugeeboard/Social Collective: Britta, Conni
* Metabrain: Moritz, Ulrike
* Nerds4Refugees/Migration Hub: Oli
* USEEDSÂ°: Maria

### Introduction Round:
* All share similiar problems: Started collecting data of projects
* Tools for initiatives
* Discussion on target group started ... main focus on refugees seeking basic information (where is which administration, where can I by a SIM card)
* Nerds4refugees as another player
* Sahana eden as management tool (Oli)
* Oli: Now tipping point, we need to find a commonly agreed platform
* Oli: Digiteers
* we need to collect to benefits
* we need to ask the question which channels do we actually use? ... distribution by natural ways
* Maria - want to contribute "utask"-days to improve UIX/frontend of metabrain

### Vision Presentation
* presenting more technical aspects
* data has to be found
* Why does Google not do it?
* initiatives have only scarce ressources
* maybe start with low user base to increase trust
* press will distribute quickly
* different kind of interactions and stakeholders
* is "static information" the right category? maybe "contact information", "core information"
* maybe don't think too complicated
* target group definition urgently needed
* useeds could also jump in with consulting
* login should be avoided (barrier)
* information on landing page on which information will be distributed
* iframe solution? (clickable small interface design to copy paste into own website)
* language solutions/multi-language solution is very hard to implement
* maybe concentrate on Berlin?
* discussion on funding: EU, Ernst&Young, small donors -> we need to stay independent with our product (keep it in our hands)
* use HXL as a database standard
* meta-tags are very important for crawlable information (comparable to #/hashtags in twitter)
* we have to reduce permanent work
* backend and interface cannot be separated in the discussion
* "metabrain" as a name should be re-thought. better solutions?

### Collaboration
* publish a mvp (minimal viable product) quickly, not complex
* use the data
* developers as first target group
* technical consortium
* data base as an identity
* interface as an own identity
* how many interfaces do we need?
* refugees as main target group
* specialized data base with metabrain as backend
* entry mask withith login and simple authorized entry
* API is important
* default data browser is needed
* how to validate data/information
* users could be part of data evaluation (stars, comments)
* emails to initiative when user identifies missing information
* reminder mails to initiatives
* microanalytics can be offered in connection with notifications
* make the last day of information update public
* give incentives out to initiatives to keep information up to date
* Useeds could help to define personas and needs of future data base users
* Metabrain embassadors to develop trust through personal contact
* Britta: Look at Foodsharing how to develop a network and PR
* use existent data base and use grassrooting
* system of recommendations
* branding a data set
* "cryptoparty" for refugee organisations ("be an angel") -> further incentive for getting data in metabrain and keeping it up to date
* meetup "silicon drinkabout", "beta breakfast"
* long-term effects needed
* we need to stay "open"
* manpower needed (Conni)
* when do we inform press? -> Conni has contacts to Frontal21 and rbb, print easy to serve, DW by Monis
* vacation of Moritz ... when?
* meeting dates can be included
* in the future: event calender
* knowledge transfer important

### Decision
* brainstorm naming
* maybe not specific for refugees
* has to be unique
* spreadsheet
* sheet for important information (wiki)
* March: small product will be published before workshop of Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) - Civil Society 4.0 - https://www.hkw.de/en/programm/projekte/2016/civil_society_4_0/civil_society_4_0_start.php
* SocialProHub can be used -> contact to Michael
* List of Collective is needed -> Social Collective needs to be publicly defined for Metabrain (and cooperation)
* Useeds workshop: 1/28-1/29
* one group with user identity research
* more groups to define on sunday (Fabian)
* Trello for working packages: https://trello.com/b/B1LMfbyn/backend
* Social Collective and Metabrain group are almost the same and should be considered as a whole (everything we do here on this weekend is relevant for the Social Collective as well)
* Melting Social Pro Hub and Refugee Board interfaces and use the data of metabrain
* project network platform seen as most important
* Landing page needed (github, launchrock.com) until tomorrow
* Prepare information on

### Feedback Britta:
* external communication and its strategy should be decided with the social collective
* this could be done via a landing page at the HKW event or our own where many projects are invited
* define clear goals and the work packages needed to achieve them

### Strategies for Keeping Data Current
* direct curation of project data at an event like the HKW
* invitation to update their data via mail
* we need to be transparent and establish a relationship of trust with the projects
* ideas for incentivizing an active relationship:
    * good feedback from us via notifications (non-spammy, useful content)
    * visible certificates, for example, for verified data, working
      relationships with the city and others
    * project reviews by users and maybe even comments
    * exclusivity
    * use good multiplicators
* Metabrain logo embedded on sites should be a sign of quality
* Entrepreneur pledge as an example to look into

### Feedback Ulrike:
* we need to closely look at our capacity to do work and possibly recruit more help
* distribution of tasks and designated responsible people for certain user
  stories which stories should we focus on?
* we need an implementation fast, that should be our focus
* what professional level do we want to reach and what is the resulting work
  load?
* Monis is in talks with Ernst & Young, an opportunity for support?

### Feedback Robert:
* a simple solution for single sign-on could be two-factor authentication
* we should fast implementation strategies (KISS)
* what happens after the "refugee crisis" is "contained"?
* Human-readable API by offering embeddable code that allows views on our data

### Feedback Markus:
* conclusively define target groups and communicate that (internally and
  externally)
* think big but then pick feasible targets
* who are "we"?
* realistic estimation of amount of work; avoid burn-outs
* create a culture for volunteer work, lower barriers for participation
* clearly mark who contributes with what capacity (time budget) and adjust
  expectations
* team organization
* organize information material
* list projects by their status, e.g., status concept, in progress, funded
* collection of projects that have a national focus (Germany)
* languages: at first German and English but build the system so it is
  extendable to N languages
* in the long run we need to ensure that metabrain is found (SEO)
* coordinate with Fabian who is invited to USEEDS and who else should maybe be
  invited
* research on what kind of users makes up the majority, this has important
  implications for the presentaiton and curation of data

### Tentative Agenda for Sunday:
* discuss category system
* what information needs to be covered and according changes to database schema
* contents of landing page, under which name to publish and one-pager
* history of the project, who is and was part of it, which events shaped it,
  attribute data collections
